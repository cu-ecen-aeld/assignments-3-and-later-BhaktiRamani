# Simple Makefile, generates executable for writer.c file using native
# build and supports cross compilation of aarch64-none-linux-gnu
# to run normally, type make
# to use cross compilation, type make CROSS_COMPILATION=aarch64-none-linux-gnu-
# Executable will generate using this perticular cross compilation but will
# not be able to run on x86 pc. 
# Logs status on fileresult.txt file
